# Description: Configuration file for Harvest
#
# Authentication Configuration
#   auth:
#     method: The authentication method to use. Valid values are 'iam', 'file', and 'saml2aws'.
#       iam: (default) Use the AWS SDK to assume roles. In this preferred configuration, the container/EC2 running the
#            API should have an IAM role with the necessary permissions to assume roles in the
#            target accounts.
#       saml2aws: Use the saml2aws CLI to assume roles. This is useful when the API is running in a local development
#                 environment or when you wish to use the Harvest API to provision AWS credentials for users.
#                 Note that this will require passing valid AWS user credentials to saml2aws. It may also require the
#                 user to authenticate with an identity provider.
#                 Furthermore, the saml2aws.config file must be configured with the necessary SAML configuration.

#   accounts: A map of AWS account IDs to role names to assume during data collection.
#   auth_method: The authentication method to use. Valid values are 'iam' and 'saml2aws'.
#
#     -
#
#     - file: Use a file to store AWS credentials. The method assumes the operator will provide credentials accessible
#             in the file path provided.
#
#   auth_args: A map of arguments to pass to the authentication method. The arguments are specific to the
#              authentication method. For 'iam', the only argument is 'role_name'. For 'saml2aws', the arguments are
#   enable_saml2aws: (false, default) A boolean value indicating whether to allow the /aws/auth/saml2aws route. If set to true, the
#                    Harvest API will allow users to authenticate with SAML to provision their AWS credentials.
